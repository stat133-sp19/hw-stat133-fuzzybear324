Introduction
============

Who is the best player on the Warriors? Is it KD or Steph? Is Draymond garbage? Is Iggy past his prime? In this article, we will take a look at the shooting percentages and shot selections of the Warriors to try to come to a conclusive ranking of the key players. Along the way, we will also take a look at the stylistic differences between key players.

Motivation
==========

While the Warriors are very good, they do not all play with the same style or even ability. Just by watching footage, it's clear that not everyone on the team is as good of a shooter as Steph or KD. Yet some more nuanced observations can be mad

Data
====

Let's take a look at the shooting percentages, going by whether the shots taken were two pointers, three pointers, and then both combined.

First let's look at just the 2pt shots.

    ##             Name Total Made Perc_Made
    ## 1 Andre Iguodala   210  134  63.80952
    ## 2   Kevin Durant   643  390  60.65319
    ## 3    Steph Curry   563  304  53.99645
    ## 4  Klay Thompson   640  329  51.40625
    ## 5 Draymond Green   346  171  49.42197

Interestingly, Andre Iguodala has the highest percentage, but that's a bit miselading as he has the fewest shot attempts. Kevin Durant impresses here with not only the most shot attempts but also the second highest percentage.

Now looking at the 3 pointers.

    ##             Name Total Made Perc_Made
    ## 1  Klay Thompson   580  246  42.41379
    ## 2    Steph Curry   687  280  40.75691
    ## 3   Kevin Durant   272  105  38.60294
    ## 4 Andre Iguodala   161   58  36.02484
    ## 5 Draymond Green   232   74  31.89655

The splash brothers are the far and away the best shooters from here, top 2 in both volume and accuracy. Klay has the highest percentage, but Steph beats him in attempts by over 100.

Combining both 2 point and 3 point attempts now:

    ##             Name Total Made Perc_Made
    ## 1   Kevin Durant   915  495  54.09836
    ## 2 Andre Iguodala   371  192  51.75202
    ## 3  Klay Thompson  1220  575  47.13115
    ## 4    Steph Curry  1250  584  46.72000
    ## 5 Draymond Green   578  245  42.38754

Kevin Durant again takes the throne at the top of the charts, with a whopping 54% shooting percentage and being the third highest in attempts.Suprisingly, Steph is second to last here. It is also intersting to note that Draymond is at the bottom of the standings among all three scenarios.

And now let's look at the shot charts of the players.

While a bit hard to make definitive statements from these charts, the key takeaway is that only Durant, Klay, and Steph take a considerable amount of midrange shots. Additionally, Step Curry has a noticeable pull up on his shot chart, indicating that he takes shots from further back than the other players.

Analsysis
=========

Steph's overwhelming advantage at shooting the 3 ball edges him over Durant.Draymond loses out to Iguodala because of his horrendous shooting at considerable volume. Iguodala at least understands he is playing with better players and thus limits his shots. Despite being suprisingly efficient at times, his lack of volume puts him below Klay.

Conclusions
===========

Based off the data and anlsyis we have seen, the rankings of the GSW players would have to be:

1.  Steph Curry
2.  Kevin Durant
3.  Klay Thompson
4.  Andre Iguodala
5.  Draymond Green
