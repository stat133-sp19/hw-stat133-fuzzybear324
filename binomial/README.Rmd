## Overview
"binomial" is a minimal package that simulates information about multiple coin tosses each with the same probability. It also can make some graphs.

## Installing
install.packages("devtools") 
devtools::install_github("stat133-sp19/hw-stat133-fuzzybear324/binomial")

## Usage
You got 2 main choices: You can either make graphs or you can look at summary statistics.
To make graphs, use either bin_distribution or bin_cumulative to make the object you want. Then plot the object to get your graph.
To get statistics, use bin_variable and then call the ojbect to get information on the object.

```{r}
bin_cumt <- bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
plot(bin_cumt)
```

```{r}
bin_variable(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
bin_variable
```
